            <description><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven’t heard <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/announcement-regarding-schedule/">the announcement I posted</a> , songs from this point on will sometimes be split among multiple episodes, so this is the second part of a two-episode look at the song “I Heard it Through the Grapevine”. This week we&#8217;re looking at the career of Marvin Gaye from 1963 through 1970, as well as his duet partners Mary Wells, Kim Weston, and Tammi Terrell, whose tragically short life comes with a great many content warnings.</p>

<p>And if you just can&#8217;t get enough of me talking, I&#8217;ve also guested this week, with Tilt and Gary from <em>The Sitcom Club</em>, on our friend Tyler&#8217;s podcast <em>Goon Pod</em>, <a href="https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/sOWWGZEBNJb">talking about the 1974 film </a><em>Man About The House.</em></p>
